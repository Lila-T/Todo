# Todo List 
Todo List is list of all the tasks that you need to carry out. By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all
in one place so you don’t forget anything important.

## Getting started
The project setup is really simple. Because we only used pure JavaScript, So you do not need to install frameworks or dependencies. The  “todo.html” file is the entry point and contains the HTML code. So you Just need to open it.
